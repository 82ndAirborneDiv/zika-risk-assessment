        You are at risk of getting Zika through sex after your partner returns from travel, even if your partner
        doesn’t have symptoms. Zika virus infection is of greatest concern for pregnant women; you can pass Zika to
        your developing fetus if you get infected during pregnancy.
        <br/><br/>
        Because Zika can cause

            <li>Do not share sex toys throughout the pregnancy.</li>

        Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider about Zika throughout your pregnancy, even if you don’t feel sick.
        Here is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pdfs/zika-clinicvisit-checklist.pdf">checklist</a> of
        important questions to discuss with your doctor. Pregnant women who have had possible sexual exposure, or who have
        lived in or traveled to an area with a current Zika outbreak, should be offered testing for Zika. See a doctor
        immediately if you or your partner have symptoms of Zika (fever, rash, joint pain, red eyes). Get more information

    Even if you don’t feel sick, you should take steps to avoid mosquito bites for 3 weeks after your trip so that you
    do not spread Zika to uninfected mosquitoes. If a mosquito bites you while the virus is still in your blood, it can
    spread the virus by biting another person.

        Countries with endemic Zika have reported cases of Zika in the past and may occasionally report new cases. A
        large number of local residents are likely to be immune, so we think the risk of getting Zika in these
        countries is lower than in countries with current Zika outbreaks. Although the risk is likely to be low, it is
        not zero.
