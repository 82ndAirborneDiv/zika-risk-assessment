        Zika can cause serious birth defects. <b>Pregnant women should avoid travel to areas with Zika.</b>
        <br />
        If you must travel, take steps to protect yourself. Zika is primarily spread by mosquitoes, so strictly follow
        steps to <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites" target="_blank">avoid mosquito bites</a> during your trip.
        Even if you don&#39;t feel sick, you should take steps to avoid mosquito bites for 3 weeks after your trip so
        that you do not spread Zika to uninfected mosquitoes. If a mosquito bites you while the virus is still in your
        blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person.

    Zika can also be spread by a man who has Zika to his sex partners, even if he doesn&#39;t have symptoms.
    If you have sex with a man who travels to or lives in an area with Zika,
    <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/male-condom-use.html" target="_blank">use condoms</a> or don't have sex during
    pregnancy.
