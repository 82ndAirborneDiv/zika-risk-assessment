                You are at risk of getting Zika <a target='_blank' href='http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html'>through sex</a> after your partner returns from travel. The risk of Zika is of

                pregnancy. Because Zika can cause
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/healtheffects/birth_defects.html">serious birth defects</a>,
                you should wait after your partner returns before trying to get pregnant, even if your partner doesn’t have
                symptoms.
                <ul>
                    <li>If your partner is male, wait at least <strong>6 months</strong> after he returns from travel before trying
                        to get pregnant. If he develops symptoms of Zika, wait at least 6 months after his symptoms begin.</li>
                    <li>If your partner is female, wait at least <strong>8 weeks</strong> after she returns from travel before
                        trying to get pregnant. If she develops symptoms of Zika, wait at least 8 weeks after her symptoms begin.

                Zika is primarily spread by mosquitoes.

            Even if you don’t feel sick, you should take steps to avoid mosquito bites for 3 weeks after your trip so that you
            do not spread Zika to uninfected mosquitoes. If a mosquito bites you while the virus is still in your blood, it
            can spread the virus by biting another person.

                Countries with endemic Zika have reported cases of Zika in the past and may occasionally report new cases. A
                large number of local residents are likely to be immune, so we think the risk of getting Zika in these
                countries is lower than in countries with current Zika outbreaks. Although the risk is likely to be low, it is
                not zero.
