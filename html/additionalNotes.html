    Countries with endemic Zika have reported cases of Zika in the past and may occasionally report new cases. A large
    number of local residents are likely to be immune, so we think the risk of getting Zika in these countries is lower
    than in countries with current Zika outbreaks. Although the risk is likely to be low, it is not zero. Because of
    the risk of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/healtheffects/birth_defects.html">birth defects</a>
    in babies born to women who are infected with Zika while pregnant, women living in areas with endemic Zika who are
